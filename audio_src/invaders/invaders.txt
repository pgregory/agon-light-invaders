This is a mix of MAME official samples and Neil Bradley's Retrocade samples, 
all of which I have modified and/or mixed myself. For the saucer, "0" wav 
works only in versions 36b16 or older but it's still currently used in 
Astro Invader and other games that require the invaders sample set 
Thanks to Neil Bradley for providing his quality samples, Enjoy! :)
